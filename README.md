# Hack JXRay

[JXRay](https://jxray.com/) is an awesome tool to help analyze Java memory issues.

It provides a 7 days trial period then either a $199 single user license or a $1/run pay-as-you-go license is needed.

I reverse engineered the jar file with [jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) and was able to generate license keys with arbitrary expiration time.

This repo is only for education purpose. All sensitive fields are all masked.

Happy hacking. :)
